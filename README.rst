This repository shows the full source code for automatic detection with high precision of the presence of COVID-19 in medical images of computed tomography (ct) scans of the lung. This system identifies the areas of the lung with lesions caused by the disease with high precision, quantifying them in relation to the total lung parenchyma. Moreover, this system aproperly distinguishes lessions caused by COVID-19 from such caused by other diseases.
